article_description      : "I don't miss books — not their smell, weight nor feel as I turn the page. This is largely thanks to products like Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite. The e-reader and its competitors, including Barnes & Noble's Nook Simple Touch, have continually raised the technological bar, while bringing the ereading experience closer to what feels like perusing an actual book. The new sixth-generation Kindle Paperwhite now nearly matches print tomes for visual clarity and quality, is just as easy to navigate and, of course, does things no physical book could ever do."

I don't miss books — not their smell, weight nor feel as I turn the page. This is largely thanks to products like Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite. The e-reader and its competitors, including Barnes & Noble's Nook Simple Touch, have continually raised the technological bar, while bringing the ereading experience closer to what feels like perusing an actual book. The new sixth-generation Kindle Paperwhite now nearly matches print tomes for visual clarity and quality, is just as easy to navigate and, of course, does things no physical book could ever do.
