In a significant move, India's telecom regulator has officially banned the practice of charging different rates for different kinds of data, over the principle of net neutrality. This means zero-rating initiatives — in particular Facebook's Free Basics platform, which offers a small set of services free of cost — will not be allowed in the country.
