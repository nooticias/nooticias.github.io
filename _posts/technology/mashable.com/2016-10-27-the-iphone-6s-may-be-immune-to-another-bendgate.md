Was "Bendgate" real? Since launching the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus last year, Apple has sold at least 180 million iPhones, yet reports of bent devices have been largely limited to a handful of videos. One of the Bendgate videographers, though, thinks he has proof that he was onto something last year, and that the upcoming iPhone 6s will be a whole lot less bendable.
