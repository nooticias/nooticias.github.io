And that’s not a place you want to put tablet consumers. Arriving roughly a year after Microsoft’s first major foray into the consumer tablet market, the Surface 2 delivers on most of its promises. It's marginally lighter and thinner than the original. It’s faster, though it’s hard to see that in action unless you play, say, a graphically intense game. It’s got great battery life and has a brilliantly sharp screen with some of the lowest reflectance I’ve seen on a tablet since the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7. So why don’t I love it?"
