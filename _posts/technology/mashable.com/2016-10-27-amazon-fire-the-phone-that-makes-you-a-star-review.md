Amazon took its time in launching the Fire phone, and it shows. Where you might expect a device carelessly thrown together to capitalize on the popularity of the Kindle Fire tablets, you instead find a remarkably well-designed piece of technology. And it's fun to use, too. Even without its fancy marquee features, the Fire phone is an odd duck. It's the first and only phone to run Amazon's forked version of Android, Fire OS. Yet Amazon's smartphone experience doesn't feel anything like a 1.0. The company has learned a thing or two about user experience from its Kindle Fire tablets, and it shows in the Fire phone.
