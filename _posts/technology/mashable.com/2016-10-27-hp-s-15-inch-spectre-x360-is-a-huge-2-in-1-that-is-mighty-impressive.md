The convertible-hybrid has returned a year wiser and significantly larger, sporting a few extra tricks. HP has, thankfully, maintained the sleek, premium design that impressed everyone so much in 2015, scaling things up for a more substantial 15.6-inch display that really brings the system’s multimedia and multitasking capability to the forefront."
