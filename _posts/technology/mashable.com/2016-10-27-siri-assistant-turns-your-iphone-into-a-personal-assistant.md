article_description      : "At the beginning of the week, Dag Kittlaus wrote a post for Mashable about the birth of the virtual assistant. Today, Dag's company, Siri, is releasing its iPhone app, Siri Assistant. Siri helps people get things done by combining intelligent voice recognition with hooks into tons of different web services, making it easy for people to use their mobile devices to get things done. When I talked to Dag a few weeks ago, he gave me a demo of what Siri Assistant is and what it does. The concept is pretty powerful: Talk to your phone and let it find and make plans for you. So instead of going directly to a website and doing a traditional search for movie tickets at a certain time, I can just say, 'Get me movie tickets for Shutter *Island around 9 pm' and options for theaters near me (or theaters that I have previously indicated are my favorites) will show up and I can then purchase tickets directly from my phone."
