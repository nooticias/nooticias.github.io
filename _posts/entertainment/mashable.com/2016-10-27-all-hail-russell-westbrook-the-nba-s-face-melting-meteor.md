PROGRAMMING NOTE: Since Westbrook just won't stop leaving a trail of utter devastation in his wake, we'll keep updating the post until he cools down — which is to say, expect this thing to run about 10,000 words by June. ______________________________________________ He's that spine-boiling Jimmy Page guitar break at the two-minute mark of "Heartbreaker."
