On Sept. 25, 2006, Steve Gleason blocked probably the most meaningful punt in NFL history. His New Orleans Saints were playing their first home game back in a city that had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina 13 months earlier. The block helped propel the Saints to a poignant 23-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. A statue titled "Rebirth" now stands outside the Louisiana Superdome commemorating Gleason's big play.
