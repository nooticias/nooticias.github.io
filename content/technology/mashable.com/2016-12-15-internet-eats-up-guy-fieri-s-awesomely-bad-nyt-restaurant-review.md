The sprawling 500-seat eatery and its adjective-heavy menu did little to impress the Times foodie. Wells shared his distaste in a stinging write-up that has spread around the web since publishing on Tuesday."

The sprawling 500-seat eatery and its adjective-heavy menu did little to impress the Times foodie. Wells shared his distaste in a stinging write-up that has spread around the web since publishing on Tuesday.
