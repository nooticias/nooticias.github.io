You know it's going to be cold when the National Weather Service hoists wind chill advisories and warnings from North Dakota to Maine. These areas are accustomed to cold, but even so, the prediction of dangerous conditions — with wind chills of at least minus-30 degrees Fahrenheit, and possibly as low as minus-45 degrees — is impressive.
