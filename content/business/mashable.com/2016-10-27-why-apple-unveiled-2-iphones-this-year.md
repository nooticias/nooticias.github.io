Ever since Apple introduced the original iPhone in 2007, it has adhered to a standard formula: Introduce one updated model the following year, discount the previous model and kill off models that are more than two year old. This year, Apple decided to shake things up by introducing two new iPhone models, discontinuing the iPhone 5, but keeping the 4S as free with a contract.
