description   : "Chris Sacca sits in a mostly empty plain white room in his Manhattan Beach, California home, far from the power brokers in San Francisco and New York. The room's lack of color only emphasizes his own abundance of it: Sacca sports his trademark black cowboy dress shirt, lush auburn beard, mussed hair and that biting corporate straight talk that rattles Twitter's board room and stock prices on Wall Street."

Chris Sacca sits in a mostly empty plain white room in his Manhattan Beach, California home, far from the power brokers in San Francisco and New York. The room's lack of color only emphasizes his own abundance of it: Sacca sports his trademark black cowboy dress shirt, lush auburn beard, mussed hair and that biting corporate straight talk that rattles Twitter's board room and stock prices on Wall Street.
