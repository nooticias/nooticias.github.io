Apple's iPhone sales might be slowing down in the rest of the world, but they grew by a phenomenal 56% in India last quarter, one of the few bright spots in Apple's otherwise "dismal" earnings. No wonder then Apple has big plans for the world's fastest-growing smartphone market, that includes setting up its stores and selling refurbished iPhones (or is that iPhone devices?) in the country. But it is likely going to be a steep uphill climb.
